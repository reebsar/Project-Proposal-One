Asian Demographics Survey.  
Pew Social Trends recently published data in a .sav file on the attitudes and demographics of Asian Americans.  
With some basic statistics we can see what different faith groups and ethnic groups feel about the position of America 
and the future of America.  
I think Processing would be a useful way to build an interactive that would display what specific ethnic groups, 
that are identified as Asian Americans think about certain topics.


State of the Arts.  
I would like to use information from the last five years of data on museums to see how cultural 
institutions fared through the recession(s).  
I think processing would help visualize museum health on America using traditional graphing methods 
that grow and change over time.


UNESCO 2013 Statistics.  Iâ€™m interested in how these tables relate to one another.  
For example, how does the countries economic status affect the literacy rate.  
I think Processing can make scatterplots that put these two metrics against each other, 
and potentially identify countries that made big changes over time.
